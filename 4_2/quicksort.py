DO IT! CHALLENGE - 4.2 Quicksort
Now it's time to improve the sort algorithm! Implement the sort function below using quicksort. The 
function should sort the people array from 'contactapp.py'. The algorithm should sort by 'name' or 'age', 
depending on what is passed in. To check, run 'contactapp.py' and verify that when you print contacts, 
the program accurately sorts the list based on the given parameter. 

Note: To more closely align with the code shown in the video, this quicksort function should return 
a new sorted list instead of modifying the list passed in (like the previous challenges).
