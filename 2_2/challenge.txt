DO IT! CHALLENGE - 2.2 Selection Sort

Create a selection sort algorithm that sorts an array in place without creating another array. The function
should sort the 'people' array from 'contactapp.py'. The algorithm should sort by 'name' or 'age', depending
on what is passed in. To check, run 'contactapp.py' and verify that when you print contacts, the program
accurately sorts the list based on the given parameter.
